              The mission at Project Caelus is to design, build, test, and
              launch a bipropellant liquid-fueled rocket to the edge of space while also
              creating opportunities that introduce young kids to the ever-growing aerospace industry and teaching the community about the importance
              of STEM education in an increasingly technological world. Through our project, we hope to show young people that it’s possible to do
              something that has never been done before and that there is no age threshold to exploring science and pushing technological boundaries.

              The Callisto I launch vehicle will utilize an improved version of the Aphlex 1C engine. The launch of Callisto I
              will be the first-ever liquid-fueled rocket launch by a high school team and among the first of all amateur groups in the world.
              The current target apogee for this inaugural rocket is 2,500 feet, and it will be a fundamental milestone in our quest for space.

              The initial Project Caelus team was created after a long round of interviews. We started as a team full of passion and curiosity, and most importantly eager to take on challenges and learn a lot. We&apos;ve come a long way, learning and growing an incredible amount since it all started, but we&apos;ll never forget where it all began.

            <TimelineItem title="Aphlex 1B - Ethanol Water Cold Flow" subtitle="September 13th, 2020" image={g}>
              After years of designs and numerous times back at the drawing board learning the ropes of liquid rocketry, Project Caelus ran its first-ever hardware test. The initial cold flow test verified initial designs for plumbing, flight software, and pressurization procedures for the ethanol propellant system. This test utilized water pressurized with nitrogen to serve as a proof-of-concept for methodology and development processes, as well as safety procedures and protocols.
            </TimelineItem>
            <TimelineItem title="AIAA YPSE Conference 2020" subtitle="October 16, 2020" image={h}>
              The Caelus team presented our design for the Aphlex 1B engine at the AIAA Young Professionals, Students, and Educators (YPSE) 2020 conference and took home the Best High School Presentation prize for our design paper titled: Development of a Cost-Effective 1.5kN Liquid-Fueled Rocket Propulsion System

            <TimelineItem title="Aphlex 1B - Nitrous Oxide Water Cold Flow" subtitle="February 27, 2021" image={hh}>
              The second essential test conducted by Project Caelus, the nitrous water cold flow test further tested plumbing system design as well as electronics, programming, and safety procedures. This test once again utilized water pressurized with nitrogen in the nitrous oxide propellant system. This test was successfully conducted 3 times in one day!

            <TimelineItem title="Aphlex 1C - Engine Redesign" subtitle="March 13, 2021" image={i}>
              With the team&apos;s growing experience and grasp of rocket science, we tackled an engine redesign to optimize our engine&apos;s performance with our hardware constraints. With this process, we increased our planned thrust from 1,500 to 2,500 Newtons and the Aphlex 1C engine has the potential to reach our target altitude of 5,000 feet with continued improvements.

            <TimelineItem title="Aphlex 1C - Ethanol Water Cold Flow" subtitle="January 23, 2022" image={j}>
              Following a complete overhaul of the electronics and programming systems for the Aphlex 1C test stand, we ensured that pressure could be handled on the ethanol side of our test stand, validated sensor data, calibration, and leak testing procedures.

            <TimelineItem title="Aphlex 1C — Nitrous Oxide Water Cold Flow" subtitle="April 2, 2022" image={jj}>
              This test ensured that the test stand can hold and maintain pressure for propellants, gain accurate readings from all sensors and probes, successfully actuate all valves, and deliver the necessary conditions for combustion to the engine, using inert water instead of reactive nitrous oxide.

            <TimelineItem title="Aphlex 1C - Full Water Cold Flow - Full Assembly" subtitle="April 3, 2022" image={ii}>
              The full water cold flow unifies the testing of the ethanol and nitrous towers by simulating the responsibility of managing two towers simultaneously. It requires improved organization and logistical management of procedures for each tower and reliability of all electronics, software, plumbing, and structural elements for each tower, as the range of failure modes is more than doubled.
            </TimelineItem>
            <TimelineItem title="Aphlex 1C – Nitrous Oxide Cold Flow" subtitle="August, 2022" image={jkl}>
              The nitrous oxide cold flow test is a major milestone as it&apos;s the first time that actual propellants will be used in a cold flow test. This test entails running self-pressurizing nitrous oxide through the nitrous plumbing system. Using nitrous oxide requires all parts of the system to be cleaned with a rigorous oxygen cleaning process, and safety procedures must be comprehensive!

            <TimelineItem title="Aphlex 1C - Static Engine Fire" subtitle="August, 2022" image={k}>
              The culmination of all of our years of hard work up until this point - this static engine fire will be an amazing and historic achievement for Project Caelus. Ethanol and nitrous oxide will flow into the Aphlex 1C engine and ignite, producing a peak of 2,500 Newtons of thrust. A key aspect of this test is the data collected which will enable high-accuracy characterization of the engine&apos;s performance, and this will prove essential in springboarding on to the future.

            <TimelineItem title="Callisto I" subtitle="June, 2023" image={l}>

            <TimelineItem title="Callisto II" subtitle="2024" image={m}>
              Beyond Callisto I, based on collected data and research findings, the Project Caelus team will progress towards larger rockets producing more thrusts and potentially using different propellant combinations. Callisto II is currently planned as an intermediary launch vehicle between Callisto I, which will launch to 10 kilometers, and Callisto III, which will launch to space.
            </TimelineItem>
            <TimelineItem title="Callisto III" subtitle="2025" image={cal333}>
              The Callisto III rocket is the current final goal of our project and will reach the Karman line, the border between Earth and space, at 100km above sea level.
